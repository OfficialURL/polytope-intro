\section{Introduction}
Welcome to the Polytope Discord! Here we discuss Polytopes, which is a general term that encompasses polygons (2D), polyhedra (3D), polychora (4D), and so on for any dimension.

There are multiple definitions for when a polytope is \textit{regular}, but they all require every element (vertices, edges, faces, etc.) to ``look the same.''

\section{Uniform polytopes}
Intuitively, a polytope is \textit{uniform} when all of its facets are regular and all of its vertices ``look the same.'' To see what we mean, let's look at a few examples.
