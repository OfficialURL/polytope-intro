\section{Introduction}
Welcome to the \href{https://discord.gg/invite/zMRu7T4}{Polytope Discord}!

\section{What is a polytope?}
A \textbf{polytope} is a general name for
\textbf{polygons} (2D), \textbf{polyhedra} (3D), \textbf{polychora} (4D),
and so on for any dimension.
As with many terms used on the Polytope Discord,
the word ``polytope'' can have a few definitions which are not completely equivalent.
All of the commonly-used ones, however, agree on the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A polytope in $n$ dimensions (known hereafter as an $n$-polytope)
  is made of \textbf{facets} which are $(n-1)$-polytopes.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Polychora ($4$-polytopes) have facets which are polyhedra ($3$-polytopes),
  \item whose facets are polygons ($2$-polytopes),
  \item whose facets are line segments ($1$-polytopes),
  \item whose facets are points ($0$-polytopes)!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  More stuff here, although the next section might break up the list,
  so it might be good not to format the whole def in terms of a list
  so that we can fit in more explanations.
\end{itemize}

For example, consider the following triangle ABC.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) node[fill=white]{$A$}
    -- (1,0) node[fill=white]{$C$}
    -- (0.5,0.866) node[fill=white]{$B$}
    -- cycle;
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

It is a polygon which contains three line segments,
or \textbf{edges}, as they are known
when mentioned as part of a larger polytope.
It also contains three points, or \textbf{vertices},
or even \textbf{verts} for short.
(In the polytope world, abbreviations are everywhere!)
More specifically, its facets are the edges
$\overline{\rm AB}$, $\overline{\rm AC}$, and $\overline{\rm BC}$,
and their facets are the vertices A, B, and C.
We keep track of what has what as a facet using a \textbf{Hasse diagram}.



\section{Regular polytopes}
There are multiple definitions for when a polytope is \textbf{regular},
but they all require every element (vertices, edges, faces, etc.) to ``look the same.''

\section{Uniform polytopes}
Intuitively, a polytope is \textbf{uniform}
when all of its facets are regular and all of its vertices ``look the same.''
To see what we mean, let's look at a few examples.

\section{CRF polytopes}
A polytope is called \textbf{convex regular-faced}, or \textbf{CRF} for short, when it is convex (without dents, holes or self-intersections) and all of its faces are regular. Let's look at a few examples.
